    "body": "I feel violated by intern season\n\nThere's this bar that I frequent a few blocks away from my house. Technically different neighborhood, but generally has a mature vibe with people who like music and to dance. Today when I went to the bar and all of a sudden I felt like I was at a college basement party. I thought that I must have been hallucinating, but Then a girl pointed at me and referred to me as the old person. That's when I knew I had to get out of there.\n I was at the wrong party. \n\nAs I walk back home, all of a sudden I realize that there were now tens of thousands of 18 year-old 19 year-old 20-year-olds who were all living on top of each other and were super young and horny to basically use the New York nightlife as their own personal orgy dome.\n Naturally I felt violated\n\nBut then again, I thought to myself. Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I've only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. \nNew York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city.",

I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well  \n\\- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022.  \n\\- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFT\n\nI see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses. Can't believe there's 2.7M members here. That alone should tell you that NFTs are no longer something people are interested in. I'd love to be proven wrong, since I feel that there was alot of potential, but so far it seems like the community is dead",

    "body": "First of all you look good! But if you want to become more \"conventionally attractive\", here are some of my suggestions. Just personal opinions, take them or leave them.\n\n  \n**Do away with glasses -** \n\nHave you considered contacts? If not you should look into it. Or lasik although that's a bit pricy (and scary to some). I did it and was the best decision ever.\n\n  \n**Work out -** \n\nmake sure to get enough protein and look into creatine as well\n\nI'd recommend losing weight though cardio &amp; eating healthier, as well as build muscle though bench and squats. Don't forget to stretch too since you can injure yourself! And get a gym rat to spot you. Once you start losing weight you'll see your face slim down as well\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BQ3QVQJ9/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BQ3QVQJ9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ULZF5HC/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ULZF5HC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n  \n**Fashion -** \n\nUniqlo is a good start, but you gotta dress well in Uniqlo\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C\\_oENHCPkft](https://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C_oENHCPkft)\n\n(If you're in Japan just buy them there it's cheaper haha)\n\nI wouldn't recommend you wearing anime related items if you're trying to be \"conventionally attractive\". Make it something very subtle, like a tiny totoro tattoo on your wrist, or a ring which doesn't shout ANIMEEEEE! Also if someone asks your about it you can elaborate on your interest, but keep it short and succinct so you don't nerd out until you know they are interested in learning more.\n\nIf you can afford it, go one layer above and try Cos\n\n[https://www.cos.com/en\\_usd/men.html](https://www.cos.com/en_usd/men.html)\n\n\n\n**Eyebrows** **-** \n\nGo get your brows done at an Indian threading place. Take a picture of it, and try to recreate it via shaver below\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079M8D8Y9/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079M8D8Y9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n  \n**Skincare -** \n\nYou seem to be on the oily side like me. Wash your face daily, and use a decent face cream and serum. Here's the ones I use.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09TV52V57/ref=ewc\\_pr\\_img\\_1?smid=AH5UK1NMFV20Y&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09TV52V57/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=AH5UK1NMFV20Y&amp;psc=1)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BL2BB4GV/ref=ewc\\_pr\\_img\\_3?smid=A25W1DZX5FW5M7&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BL2BB4GV/ref=ewc_pr_img_3?smid=A25W1DZX5FW5M7&amp;psc=1)\n\n  \n**Hair** \\- \n\nHonestly I don't know. You could grow it out, shave it, or keep as is. If you're going to shave it keep the beard because you gotta keep one of them. If you're worried about balding there's these crazy services in Turkey where they will regrow your hair (example below). My colleague did it and he looked messed up for a month but now looks amazing (not at this particular spot).\n\n[https://cosmedica.com/](https://cosmedica.com/)\n\n  \nLast but not least, get yourself out there! Getting experience with women/men whoever you are attracted to, is the best way to build confidence. Make mistakes, learn, and grow as a person.\n\nWishing the best for you!",

As for the brands that veve partnered with, they probably saw it more as a marketing opportunity, and considering how a few people care about NFTs, they see the impact of their apathy as negligible to the overall brand image.\u00a0\nDisney for instance, have received way more flack about trying to use Disney+ terms and conditions on the victim who died in their theme park.\u00a0\nThe reality is that mainstream attention has moved away from NFTs (if there ever was any), and so they\u2019ve written it off as one of the many, many things they\u2019d like to sweep under the rug.",

PE will give you both.\n\nThere's a reason why it's such a highly coveted career in the white collar space.\n\nThe most straight forward way to get there is to get into a target school, maintain high GPA, get into a good IB program, then recruit for PE.\n\nIs it competitive? Yes. Is it going to be long hours and hard work? Yes. But it'll set you and your future generation for financial independence. Being from a wealthy family who can donate their way into an ivy league school or have family friends who are GPs would make it much much much easier, but you can make it happen with hard work and dedication.\n\n  \n(Of course, similar to the tech meltdown, it's unclear if this model will be viable a decade or two in the future. But if the rich are going to get richer, it will continue to happen through PE, and you'll get a piece of that pie being at the table)",

They surveyed the island, took biological records of the wildlife, and to an extent modernized Taiwan. I was surprised to see how a sizable portion of Taiwan\u2019s natural history museum were contributions by Japanese scientists when I went to Taipei.\n\nHowever, I think it\u2019s about how people in Taiwan perceive Japanese occupation which is relevant. This actually isn\u2019t entirely about what Japan did in Taiwan, but what came after. The kuomintang led nationalist government committed mass murder (known as the 228 incident), which made those who lived through both eras look back fondly at the era of Japanese occupation.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to justify colonialism, but feel that the atrocities by the nationalism government seems to have painted a (relatively) positive light of the Japanese occupation in the eyes of the elders.\u00a0\n\nI am curious to hear a Taiwanese persons\u2019 perspective on this though, because my understanding is that the occupying japanese forces also did their fair share of inhumane acts during the occupation.",

If you're putting up Japanese artwork as art and is respecting it, I doubt any Japanese person will take offense. But making some cheap piece of clothing and branding it as \"kimono\" since it will sell better is disrespectful in my eyes.\n\nI think the keyword here is \"authenticity\" and \"respect\". As long as one adopts a culture with these in mind, there is nothing wrong with it. But it's ultimately up to those who belong in the original culture to decide if these standards are being met. Obviously there is no \"singular hive mind of Japanese consciousness\", and the answer will depend from person to person. \n\nAs Japan becomes more racially/culturally diverse (albeit slower than most other nations), these definitions will shift. A Ukrainian born woman (ethnically entirely white European) just became Ms. Japan, which led to alot of backlash. Personally I think this is a welcoming change as Japan embraces diversity, especially as she is much more culturally Japanese than most ethnically Japanese people. I feel Japan should redefine what it means to be Japanese, and cultural symbols like her or Osaka Naomi, Rui Hachimura, are pushing the envelope in a positive way.\n\n\n\nAnd to answer your question:\n\nTraditionally (pre industrial revolution) kimonos were worn by people of different social class for a variety of occasions. Kimono actually means \"clothes\", which includes sub categories such as samui (work clothes) or yukata (summer clothes). There's also a word for western clothes (\u6d0b\u670d), which is what most people wear these days.\n\nIn modern era, there are certain occasions you are more likely to see it (e.g. summer festivals, tea ceremony, black tie events), but it's not uncommon to see people wearing kimono on the streets any time of the year. \n\nMaybe it's worth having a conversation with your daughter-in-law to get her perspective on it.",

    "body": "Would you guys like to see Pokemon Go in AVP?\n\nHi guys,\n\nI think Pokemon could be one of the killer use case for the vision pro. Imagine, you could fight players from around the world from the comfort of your couch. With the recent controversy around Palworld, they're looking for the next \"Pokemon Go\" that would propel their franchise to the next level.\n\nBeing Japanese, I happen to know a few key decision makers both in the Pokemon Company as well as Niantic. Alot of the in-game designs are transferrable, and I believe it's a matter of time until Niantic's Lightship ARDK will work on AVP.\n\n*What should I tell them? Lmk if you have thoughts or useful links/videos I should forward to them.*\n\nI'm confident that this will eventually become a thing, but the faster they ship the more AVP adoption we'll see.\n\n[personal info redacted for obvious reasons](https://preview.redd.it/be7qbqfg5qgc1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21fec81575a29fa53fc01639e368980dc4c5ac6f)",

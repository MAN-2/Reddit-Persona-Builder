They mention that they often don't finish games due to insufficient late-game content. They suggest strategies for resource gathering, such as killing bandit units, donating crop yields through the manor, and trading raw materials for easier profit. They find trading raw materials more convenient than trading crafted goods in the current game build.\n\nHowever, they note that high-demand items like plate armor are difficult to trade due to their low quantity and time-consuming production process. They also share their struggle when upgrading to tier 3, which caused their town to become chaotic due to increased resource demands. Lastly, they mention that each family in the game consumes all types of food equally, and since eggs are produced only once per month, they can help maintain food diversity but may not be sufficient on their own.",

The second comment expresses frustration with a health insurance claim denial, indicating a personal experience with an insurance company.\n\nThe third and fourth comments seem to be in the context of a hypothetical zombie apocalypse, as the user suggests stocking up on axes, sledgehammers, generator magazines, skill tapes, and securing food and water, along with suggestions for home modifications to prevent zombie access. The \"burglar trait\" in the fourth comment might be a reference to a game or fantasy scenario, as it seems out of place in the context of the zombie apocalypse setup. The phrase \"iykyk\" is internet slang that stands for \"if you know, you know,\" implying that the described scenario is specific or obscure enough that only those familiar with it would understand.",

They encountered police officers who wanted to fine them, but a 'common man' intervened and negotiated a bribe on their behalf. The user clarifies that this 'common man' was actually an agent and shield for the police. They also mention that in their area, malls are considered a thing of the past, and rents are high despite low demand in the LKO region.",
